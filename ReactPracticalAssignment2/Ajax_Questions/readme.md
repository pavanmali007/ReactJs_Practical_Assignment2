## AJAX Practical Questions:  

6. Develop a webpage that retrieves and displays data from a public JSON API (e.g., a list of books,  
movies, or weather information) using AJAX. Display this data in a visually appealing manner 
on  the page.  

7. Create an autocomplete search feature using AJAX and jQuery. When users start typing a query  
into a search input field, dynamically fetch and display matching results from an API as  
dropdown suggestions.  

8. Build a real-time chat application using AJAX to send and receive messages without refreshing  
the page. Messages should be displayed on the page as they are sent and received. 

9. Design a "Load More" button that, when clicked, fetches additional content from an API and  
appends it to an existing list on the webpage. Implement pagination using AJAX. 
 
10. Develop a weather app that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve weather data from 
a weather API using AJAX. Display the temperature, weather description, and an icon 
representing  the weather condition. Allow users to refresh the weather data without reloading 
the entire  page.
